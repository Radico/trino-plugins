# Code of Conduct

Contributors pledge to make participation in the project community a positive, open, and welcoming experience for others.

Examples of behavior that contributes to this environment:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what's best for the community and the project
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this contributor agreement, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community such as on social media or at a public event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers or Simon Data, Inc.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the team at report-abuse@simondata.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

This Contributor Agreement is adapted in part from the "Contributor Covenant", available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html
